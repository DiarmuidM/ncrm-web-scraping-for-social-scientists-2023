## Data Challenges

For your practical exercise, please choose one of the following challenges to complete.

### Challenge 1 - Desert Island Discs

Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 show that interviews persons of interest about the lives, with a particular focus on the music and items that would accompany them if they were stuck on a desert island. Your colleague, who is a sociologist of culture, has asked you to collect summary information for the most recent set of episodes:
* Scrape data for the most recent episode [Beginner]
* Scrape data for the ten most recent episodes [Intermediate]
* Create a list of all of the episodes available on the website [Advanced]
